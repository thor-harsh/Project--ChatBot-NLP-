# Project--ChatBot-NLP-

<table>
  
**In this project we will building a Q/A ChatBot using RNN(Recurrent Neural Network) with LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) in Natural Language Processing using Python.** <br></br>

**First of all Thanks Jose for this amazing assement. Lets look at the Overview of Working in Single Layers:** <br></br>

**Given Inputs are:** <br></br>
1: Story(It will be just the sequences of sentences which will be feeded into the embedding layer 'A' to form memrory vector(m) <br></br>
2: Questions(It will be questions asked w.r.t sentences which will be feeded into the embedding layer 'B' to form input vector(u) <br></br>

Then we will perform inner product of m and u. Then we will apply softmax function on that. Soon After we will put our Story into another embedding layer 'C' and then we will calculate its weighted sum and assigned it as output(o).After this we will perform o(summation with u) which will give us weight. After which we will apply softmax on this to get the predicted answer. <br></br>

**Output:** <br></br>
3: Answer(i.e whether answer is 'Yes' or 'No') <br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand LSTM(Long Short Term Memory), RNN(Recurrent Neural Network), and NLP(Natural Language Processing) First**...<br></br>

**What is (LSTM)Long Short Term Memory?** <br></br>

LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) aimed at dealing with the vanishing gradient problem present in traditional RNNs. Its relative insensitivity to gap length is its advantage over other RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods. <br></br>

**What is (RNN)Recurrent Neural Network?** <br></br> 
A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a deep learning model that is trained to process and convert a sequential data input into a specific sequential data output.<br></br>

**What is (NLP)Natural Language Processing**? <br></br>

NLP or Natural language processing is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics. It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language.<br></br>

NLP combines computational linguistics‚Äîrule-based modeling of human language‚Äîwith statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer‚Äôs intent and sentiment.<br></br>

NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly‚Äîeven in real time. There‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.<br></br>


**Important Note: Go through the research paper attached above and get the understanding of both as well go through both the training file and test file and get to know the dataset before jumping to the code.**
